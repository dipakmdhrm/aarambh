# Aarambh

**Aarambh** (आरम्भ, "the beginning") is a graphical UEFI boot menu for Linux.
It replaces the GRUB or systemd-boot menu with animated, full-screen panels and
hands over to a matching Plymouth splash, so the screen never goes black
between the firmware logo and the login screen.

It works with any Linux distribution that boots in UEFI mode, and with several
of them installed side by side. Windows and other EFI loaders on the same disk
are found automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Supported hardware: 64-bit x86 PCs (`x86_64`, Intel or AMD) with 64-bit
> UEFI firmware. Secure Boot can stay on.**
>
> Not supported: ARM (`aarch64`, Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon, Snapdragon
> laptops), 32-bit PCs (`i686`), 32-bit UEFI firmware (some Atom tablets),
> RISC-V, and legacy BIOS / CSM mode. The installer checks this and stops
> before changing anything.
>
> Check your machine:
>
> ```sh
> uname -m                                  # must print x86_64
> cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size    # must print 64 (missing = BIOS mode)
> ```

Aarambh runs before any operating system starts. Every section below can be
expanded, so you can see exactly what it does to your machine before you
install it.

## Themes

13 built-in themes. Switch with `aarambh --theme <name>`; each has a matching
boot, restart and shutdown splash.

## Quick start

Install the build tools for your distribution:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential gnu-efi curl efibootmgr         # Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS
sudo dnf install gcc make gnu-efi-devel curl efibootmgr          # Fedora, RHEL, Rocky, CentOS
sudo zypper install gcc make gnu-efi curl efibootmgr             # openSUSE
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel gnu-efi curl efibootmgr       # Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS
```

Then build and install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NarkAgni/aarambh.git
cd aarambh
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run     # optional: show every change first
make install                       # default theme (accordion)
```

To install with a theme and a default OS in one go:

```sh
make install THEME=cinema DEFAULT=fedora
# same as: ./scripts/install.sh --theme cinema --default fedora
```

List the themes first, before installing (no root needed):

```sh
make themes
# same as: ./scripts/install.sh --list-themes
```

Screenshots of each are under **Themes** in *Using Aarambh*. A wrong name stops
the installer before anything is changed. The Plymouth boot splash follows the
theme automatically, nothing else to install.

On every other Linux on the same disk, boot it once and run:

```sh
sudo bash /boot/efi/EFI/aarambh/hooks/setup.sh
```

(If that OS mounts the EFI partition at `/efi` or `/boot`, use that path
instead of `/boot/efi`.)

Change the theme or default OS any time later, from any connected OS:

```sh
aarambh --themes                           # list themes, * marks the current one
aarambh --theme editorial-dark             # switch theme
aarambh --default ubuntu --timeout 5       # default OS and countdown
```

The change applies from the next boot for every OS on the disk. To try a
theme without touching your real boot menu, run `make qemu THEME=hud`.

**Updating Aarambh.** Pull the new version and run `make install` on one OS as
before. It updates the boot menu and copies the new hooks to the EFI
partition. Then run the `setup.sh` line above once on every other Linux OS,
so its OS-side parts (Plymouth theme, `aarambh` command, boot service) are
updated too. Windows needs nothing. Kernel updates, theme and default changes
never need this step.

> **Secure Boot can stay on.** The installer signs Aarambh and starts it
> through your distribution's shim. If your PC does not trust the signing key
> yet, the installer prints an 8-digit password and a blue **Perform MOK
> management** screen appears once at the next restart: choose **Enroll MOK →
> Continue → Yes**, type the password, then **Reboot**. See **Secure Boot**
> under *Safety and recovery*.

**Something went wrong?** Start the system once it boots again (see *Safety
and recovery*), then run `aarambh-debug`, or `make debug` from the source
folder if the install did not finish. It writes one report file with
everything needed to find the problem; attach it to an
[issue](https://github.com/NarkAgni/aarambh/issues/new).

## What Aarambh is

<details>
<summary><b>What is Aarambh, in one paragraph?</b></summary>

<br>

Aarambh is a single UEFI application (`aarambh.efi`) that your firmware starts
instead of GRUB or systemd-boot. It draws a menu with one panel per operating
system plus Firmware, Restart and Power Off. When you pick an OS it either
starts the Linux kernel directly, or hands over to that OS's own loader (shim,
GRUB, systemd-boot, Windows Boot Manager). It does not replace or uninstall
any boot loader or kernel.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Features</b></summary>

<br>

- Accordion layout: the selected OS expands, the others collapse into side panels
- Works with every UEFI Linux distribution, with GRUB, GRUB + BLS or systemd-boot
- Finds Windows and other EFI loaders on the disk on its own
- Advanced options list with every installed kernel and recovery mode
- Direct Linux boot, with the OS's own boot loader as the fallback
- One-time kernel choice: pick an older kernel for one boot only
- Firmware setup, Restart and Power Off entries
- Matching Plymouth splash for a boot with no black screen
- Every change is recorded and can be undone with `hooks/uninstall.sh`
- 13 built-in themes, each with its own colors, switchable with one config line
- Theme API: new looks are drawn on top of a shared core, widgets and theme kit

Which kernels can start directly:

| Where the kernels live                         | Direct boot              |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| On the EFI partition (systemd-boot, ESP=/boot) | Every kernel, in place   |
| On another partition (most GRUB installs)      | The newest kernel, copied to the ESP |

Firmware, Restart and Power Off call the UEFI runtime services directly.
Firmware sets the `OsIndications` variable so the machine reboots into the
firmware setup screen.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why the screen never goes black</b></summary>

<br>

A normal boot shows several different screens: firmware logo, boot loader
menu, a black gap while the kernel loads, then the Plymouth splash. Aarambh
removes the gaps:

- **GRUB is hidden, not removed.** Its timeout is set to `0` and its menu is
  hidden, so it passes through instantly when it is used at all.
- **Kernels skip the boot loader.** Aarambh starts them directly from the ESP.
- **The splash continues the menu, in every theme.** Just before a direct
  boot, Aarambh renders the last frame of the current theme's launch splash
  (without its dots) and appends it to the initrd as a small cpio archive.
  Linux unpacks it over the installed `aarambh` Plymouth theme, so Plymouth
  shows exactly that frame and animates the dots where Aarambh left them.
  Changing the theme needs no initramfs rebuild and works for every OS.
- **Plymouth starts immediately.** `ShowDelay=0` is set. On distributions using
  initramfs-tools (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, ...) with Intel graphics, the `i915`
  driver is added to the initramfs so the graphics mode is ready early.

## Supported systems

<details>
<summary><b>Distributions and what is detected</b></summary>

<br>

`hooks/setup.sh` detects everything from the running system; nothing is
hard-coded per distribution.

| Detected                | How                                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Distribution            | `ID`, `ID_LIKE` and `NAME` from `/etc/os-release`          |
| EFI partition           | vfat mounted at `/boot/efi`, `/efi` or `/boot`, or `bootctl --print-esp-path` |
| Boot loader             | GRUB (`/etc/default/grub` + `update-grub`/`grub-mkconfig`/`grub2-mkconfig`), otherwise systemd-boot |
| Kernel list             | BLS entries (Fedora family, systemd-boot) or kernel files in `/boot` |
| GRUB menu ids           | Read from the generated `grub.cfg`, so they match your distribution exactly |
| Microcode               | `intel-ucode.img`, `amd-ucode.img` and the other images GRUB knows, joined in front of the initramfs |
| Initramfs generator     | initramfs-tools, dracut, mkinitcpio or booster             |
| Kernel update hooks     | Whatever this system runs: initramfs-tools, kernel-install, mkinitcpio, `/etc/kernel/postinst.d`, Void's `kernel.d`, GRUB |
| OS loader on the ESP    | The `\EFI\<dir>\` whose `grub.cfg` points at this system, then `\EFI\<ID>\`, then `--loader` |

| Family               | Examples                                         | Status |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Debian               | Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, elementary, Zorin, Kali, deepin | Supported |
| Fedora / Red Hat     | Fedora, RHEL, CentOS Stream, Rocky               | Supported |
| openSUSE             | Tumbleweed, Leap, Slowroll                       | Supported |
| Arch                 | Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Garuda, CachyOS, Artix | Supported (GRUB or systemd-boot) |
| Independent          | Gentoo, Void                                     | Supported |
| NixOS                | NixOS                                            | Menu entry through autodetect only; `setup.sh` does not run on NixOS's read-only `/etc` |
| Windows              | Windows 10, 11                                   | Menu entry through autodetect |

Ubuntu and Fedora are tested on real hardware. Every family above is covered
by the automated tests in `tests/hooks/` (`make test`), which run `setup.sh`
and `uninstall.sh` against simulated installations. If something does not
work on your distribution, please open an issue with the report from
`aarambh-debug` (or `make debug`).

<summary><b>Hardware and firmware</b></summary>

<br>

| Machine                                        | Status        |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 64-bit x86 PC (`x86_64`, Intel or AMD), 64-bit UEFI | Supported |
| ARM64 (`aarch64`): Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon, Snapdragon, ARM servers | Not supported |
| 32-bit x86 (`i686`)                            | Not supported |
| 64-bit CPU with 32-bit UEFI firmware           | Not supported |
| RISC-V                                         | Not supported |
| Legacy BIOS / CSM boot                         | Not supported |
| Secure Boot on                                 | Supported, through the distribution's shim (or sbctl keys) |

`aarambh.efi` is built for `x86_64` UEFI only (`Makefile`: `ARCH := x86_64`),
and the loaders it looks for (`shimx64.efi`, `grubx64.efi`,
`systemd-bootx64.efi`) are the x86_64 ones. `make` and `scripts/install.sh`
stop with an error on any other machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Distribution ids for logos</b></summary>

<br>

Each OS uses `logos/<id>.png`, `backgrounds/<id>.jpg` and `plymouth/<id>/`,
where `<id>` is the `ID=` value from `/etc/os-release`. Check yours with:

```sh
grep -E '^(ID|ID_LIKE)=' /etc/os-release
```

Every OS below ships with its own logo (from `assets/custom/`), wallpaper and
Plymouth theme, named and colored in `assets/distros.conf`:

| id | Distribution | id | Distribution |
|----|--------------|----|--------------|
| `ubuntu` | Ubuntu | `opensuse-tumbleweed` | openSUSE Tumbleweed |
| `debian` | Debian | `opensuse-leap` | openSUSE Leap |
| `linuxmint` | Linux Mint | `opensuse-slowroll` | openSUSE Slowroll |
| `pop` | Pop!_OS | `arch` | Arch Linux |
| `elementary` | elementary OS | `manjaro` | Manjaro |
| `zorin` | Zorin OS | `endeavouros` | EndeavourOS |
| `kali` | Kali Linux | `garuda` | Garuda Linux |
| `deepin` | deepin | `cachyos` | CachyOS |
| `fedora` | Fedora | `artix` | Artix Linux |
| `rhel` | Red Hat Enterprise Linux | `gentoo` | Gentoo |
| `centos` | CentOS Stream | `void` | Void Linux |
| `rocky` | Rocky Linux | `nixos` | NixOS |
| `windows` | Windows (autodetected) | `linux` | Any other Linux found through GRUB |

Any other distribution still works: add `assets/custom/<id>-logo.svg` and a line
in `distros.conf` (see **Custom logos** under *Using Aarambh*).

Autodetected `systemd-boot` and `refind` entries have no logo of their own.

Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu report `ID=ubuntu` and use the Ubuntu look.
An OS without a logo is shown with the first letter of its name and its accent
color, so a missing logo never breaks the menu.

## What the installer changes

<details>
<summary><b>Why does Aarambh need root (sudo)?</b></summary>

<br>

Every step that needs root, and why:

| Action                                         | Why root is needed                               |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Copy files to the EFI partition                | It is mounted read-only for normal users         |
| Create the "Aarambh" boot entry (`efibootmgr`) | Writes firmware NVRAM variables                  |
| Install scripts to `/usr/local` and `/etc`     | System directories                               |
| Edit `/etc/default/grub`, regenerate `grub.cfg`| System boot loader configuration                 |
| Install the Plymouth theme, rebuild initramfs  | System boot files                                |
| Enable `aarambh-clear.service`, `aarambh-shutdown-splash.service` | System-wide systemd units          |
| Sign Aarambh and kernels, ask shim to enroll the key (`mokutil`) | The signing key is root-only; enrollment writes firmware variables |

`make` (the build) and `make test` never need root. Only `scripts/install.sh`,
`hooks/setup.sh` and `hooks/uninstall.sh` use `sudo`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>See every change before it happens (<code>--dry-run</code>)</b></summary>

<br>

```sh
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run
sudo bash /boot/efi/EFI/aarambh/hooks/setup.sh --dry-run
```

Both print what they detected and every command and file write they would
make, without changing anything.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What <code>scripts/install.sh</code> does</b></summary>

<br>

Run once, from the OS you install from:

1. Checks the system booted in UEFI mode and finds the EFI partition.
2. Builds `build/aarambh.efi` with `make`.
3. Removes files left by older Aarambh versions from `\EFI\aarambh\`. Nothing
   outside that folder is touched.
4. Copies `aarambh.efi`, `distros.conf`, `fonts/`, `logos/`, `backgrounds/`,
   `plymouth/` and `hooks/` into `\EFI\aarambh\`. An existing `aarambh.conf`
   is kept, because it holds the entries of your other systems; use
   `--reset-config` to replace it with the default.
5. Runs `hooks/setup.sh` for the current OS, which also signs Aarambh for
   Secure Boot (see **Secure Boot** under *Safety and recovery*).
6. Creates a firmware boot entry named **Aarambh** with `efibootmgr`. It
   starts shim when Aarambh is signed, `aarambh.efi` otherwise. An existing
   entry with the same path is kept, one with another path is replaced.
   `efibootmgr` puts a new entry first in `BootOrder`. Your existing boot
   entries stay.

7. With `--theme` or `--default`, sets them in `aarambh.conf` through the
   `aarambh` command.

Options: `--dry-run`, `--reset-config`, `--theme <name>`, `--default <os>`,
plus any `setup.sh` option. `make install THEME=<name> DEFAULT=<os>` passes the
last two through.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What <code>hooks/setup.sh</code> does</b></summary>

<br>

Run once on **each** Linux installation that Aarambh boots.

1. Detects the distribution, EFI partition, boot loader, initramfs generator
   and the OS loader on the ESP, and prints them.
2. Writes `/etc/aarambh.env` with those results.
3. Installs the helper scripts (see the next section).
4. Installs the refresh trigger into every kernel hook directory this system
   uses.
5. Installs and enables `aarambh-clear.service` and
   `aarambh-shutdown-splash.service` (systemd only).
6. Adds or updates this OS's line in `aarambh.conf`.
7. GRUB only: makes GRUB silent (see **GRUB changes** below).
8. initramfs-tools only: `MODULES=dep` and, with Intel graphics, `i915`.
9. Installs the Plymouth theme for this distribution, if Plymouth is
   installed and a theme exists for its id.
10. Rebuilds the initramfs (only when steps 8 or 9 changed something) and
    regenerates `grub.cfg`.
11. Runs `aarambh-kernels` once and prints the kernel list.
12. Secure Boot: picks the signing key, copies shim and MokManager next to
    Aarambh, signs `aarambh.efi` and the direct-boot kernel and, with Secure
    Boot on and an untrusted key, asks shim to enroll it and prints the
    password.

Every file it creates is listed in `/etc/aarambh/manifest`. Every system file
it edits is first copied to `<file>.aarambh-backup`.

Options:

| Option                          | Effect                                         |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `--dry-run`                     | Print the changes, change nothing              |
| `--no-plymouth`                 | Leave the boot splash alone                    |
| `--loader '\EFI\<dir>\<file>.efi'` | Use this loader when detection cannot find it |

The refresh trigger is `hooks/triggers/aarambh-refresh`. It ends with
`|| true; exit 0`, so a problem in Aarambh never breaks a kernel update.
Kernel updates need no action from you.

Without systemd the one-time choice is still reset: Aarambh rewrites
`next-<os>.cfg` on every boot it starts.

<summary><b>GRUB changes</b></summary>

<br>

GRUB stays installed and keeps working. Aarambh only makes it silent. The
original is saved as `/etc/default/grub.aarambh-backup` before the first
change.

All GRUB systems:

| Setting        | New value | Reason                              |

GRUB systems without BLS (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, openSUSE, Gentoo, ...):

| Setting                   | New value     | Reason                                         |

To reach the GRUB menu after installing, hold **Esc** or **Shift** while GRUB
starts, or pick the distribution's own entry from your firmware boot menu.

systemd-boot systems: `loader.conf` is not changed. Aarambh sets
`LoaderEntryOneShot` when it hands over, so systemd-boot boots the chosen entry.

<details>
<summary><b>What Aarambh stores on the EFI partition</b></summary>

<br>

```
\EFI\aarambh\
├── aarambh.efi                  The boot menu
├── aarambh.conf                 Menu configuration (one line per OS)

```

Nothing is written outside `\EFI\aarambh\`. The direct-boot copy is the
largest item. Before copying, `aarambh-kernels` checks that at least 8 MB of
the ESP stays free. If the kernel does not fit, it deletes `linux\<id>\`,
prints a warning and that OS boots through its own loader instead. Systems
whose kernels already live on the ESP (systemd-boot, ESP mounted at `/boot`)
need no copy at all.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What <code>aarambh.efi</code> can and cannot do at boot</b></summary>

<br>

At boot time Aarambh:

- reads files inside `\EFI\aarambh\`, kernel files named in `<id>.kernels`,
  and the folder names under `\EFI\` (for autodetect)
- writes only `next-<id>.cfg` on the ESP
- writes firmware variables only when you act: `OsIndications` when you choose
  **Firmware**, `LoaderEntryOneShot` when it hands over to systemd-boot
- has no network code and sends nothing anywhere

It cannot read your Linux partitions. Kernels for direct boot are either
already on the ESP or copies made by the hook while Linux was running.

</details>

## Safety and recovery

<details>
<summary><b>Secure Boot</b></summary>

<br>

Aarambh works with Secure Boot on. Nothing has to be set up by hand:

```
Firmware (trusts Microsoft's keys)
  → shimx64.efi          your distribution's shim, signed by Microsoft
  → grubx64.efi          Aarambh, signed with your Machine Owner Key (MOK)
  → menu
  → Linux: the kernel is checked by shim, then started directly
  → Windows: bootmgfw.efi, signed by Microsoft
```

**How it is set up.** `setup.sh` finds a shim on the EFI partition (this OS's
first, then any other distribution's) and copies it, with MokManager, into
`\EFI\aarambh\`. It signs `aarambh.efi` and saves it as the file shim starts
(`grubx64.efi`, or `grub.efi` with openSUSE's shim). `install.sh` then points
the **Aarambh** boot entry at that shim.

**Which key.** A key your PC already trusts is reused, so most PCs need no
extra step at all:

| Key                                             | Comes from |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der`              | Ubuntu, Debian (made for DKMS drivers such as NVIDIA) |
| `/etc/pki/akmods/certs/public_key.der`          | Fedora akmods |
| `/var/lib/dkms/mok.pub`                         | DKMS 3 |
| `/var/lib/aarambh/keys/aarambh.der`             | Made by Aarambh when none of the above exists |

**The one-time step.** When the key is not trusted yet, `setup.sh` asks shim
to enroll it and prints a random 8-digit password. At the next restart a blue
**Perform MOK management** screen appears: **Enroll MOK → Continue → Yes**,
type the password, **Reboot**. The password is only digits because MokManager
reads every keyboard as a US layout, and the digit keys are in the same place
on all layouts. It is kept root-only in `/var/lib/aarambh/keys/mok-password`;
`sudo aarambh-sign --password` shows it again. If you miss the screen, nothing
breaks: shim cannot start Aarambh, the firmware moves on to your OS's own boot
entry, and the screen comes back at the next restart.

**Kernels.** Aarambh asks shim to check every kernel and loader it starts, the
same check GRUB uses. Distribution kernels pass, kernels signed with your MOK
key pass, anything else is refused and Aarambh shows **"Blocked by Secure
Boot"** and starts your OS's own boot loader instead. The kernel copy made for
direct boot is signed with the OS's key, so every Linux on the disk boots
directly, whichever distribution's shim started Aarambh. Kernel updates are
signed automatically.

**Turning Secure Boot on later.** Aarambh is signed even with Secure Boot off.
If you turn it on and the key is not enrolled yet, the PC starts your OS's own
boot loader once, `aarambh-sign` notices at that start and asks shim to enroll
the key, and the blue screen appears at the following restart. Read the
password with `sudo aarambh-sign --password` before you restart.

**Shim updates.** `aarambh-sign` copies a newer shim and MokManager next to
Aarambh after apt and pacman updates and at every start, so shim updates and
SBAT revocations reach Aarambh's copy too.

**sbctl.** Without shim, keys you enrolled with `sbctl` are used, and the
firmware checks Aarambh and the kernels directly.

**Removing the key.** `uninstall.sh --purge` asks shim to remove Aarambh's own
key (never a DKMS, akmods or shim-signed key) at the next restart: **Delete MOK
→ Continue → Yes**, with the password it prints.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>If Aarambh does not start or shows an error</b></summary>

<br>

Your old boot path is never removed:

1. Open your firmware boot menu (often **F12**, **F8**, **F11** or **Esc** at
   power on, depending on the vendor).
2. Choose your distribution's own entry (`ubuntu`, `fedora`, `GRUB`,
   `Linux Boot Manager`, ...). That starts its loader exactly as before.
3. Once in Linux, fix or remove Aarambh (see below).

If a system fails to start from the menu, Aarambh shows **"Could not start
this system"** and returns to the menu instead of hanging.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Uninstall</b></summary>

<br>

On each Linux installation that ran `setup.sh`:

```sh
sudo bash /boot/efi/EFI/aarambh/hooks/uninstall.sh
```

This removes its menu entry, its files on the ESP, every file listed in
`/etc/aarambh/manifest`, restores every `*.aarambh-backup` (GRUB defaults,
Plymouth and initramfs settings), switches the Plymouth theme back, and
regenerates the initramfs and `grub.cfg`.

On the last installation, add `--purge` to also delete `\EFI\aarambh\` and the
"Aarambh" firmware boot entry:

```sh
sudo bash /boot/efi/EFI/aarambh/hooks/uninstall.sh --purge
```

Both accept `--dry-run`. `make uninstall` runs the first command from the repo.

## Using Aarambh

<details>
<summary><b>Keyboard</b></summary>

<br>

| Key                 | Action                         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Left / Right        | Switch entry                   |
| 1 - 9, Home, End    | Jump to entry                  |
| Enter / Space       | Start                          |
| Down, then Enter    | Open advanced options          |
| Up / Down           | Choose a kernel in the list    |
| Esc / Backspace     | Close advanced options         |
| E                   | Edit boot options (see below)  |

Themes that list OSes vertically swap the arrows: Up / Down switch entry and
Right opens the kernel list. Every theme shows the keys that work right now
at the bottom of the screen. Any key press stops the countdown.

**Editing boot options (E).** Like GRUB's `e`, E opens the kernel command line
of the selected entry, or of the kernel highlighted in the list, for one boot.

| Key in the editor   | Action                                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Enter               | Boot with the edited command line         |
| Esc                 | Cancel                                    |
| Ctrl+R              | Restore the original command line         |
| Left / Right, Home / End | Move the cursor                      |
| Backspace / Delete  | Delete before / at the cursor             |

Nothing is saved: the next boot uses the normal command line again. To change
it for good, see **Kernel command line for direct boot**. E works only for
kernels Aarambh starts itself; Windows, Firmware and entries booted through
GRUB do not show it (use GRUB's own `e` there). An edited boot never falls
back to GRUB, because that would silently drop the edit.

Anyone at the keyboard can use E to boot with `init=/bin/bash` and get a root
shell, as with an unprotected GRUB. Turn it off with `edit no` in
`aarambh.conf`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration (<code>aarambh.conf</code>)</b></summary>

<br>

The file lives at `\EFI\aarambh\aarambh.conf` and is read at every boot.
`setup.sh` adds one `entry` line per Linux installation; you can edit titles,
colors and order by hand.

```

| Key            | Meaning                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `theme`        | Theme name, see **Themes** below                      |
| `timeout`      | Seconds before the default entry starts, `0` disables |
| `default`      | Default entry: OS id (`ubuntu`, `fedora`, `windows`), menu title, or index starting at 0 |
| `autodetect`   | `yes` adds loaders found under `\EFI\` (Windows, other OSes) |
| `edit`         | `yes` (default) lets E edit boot options, `no` turns it off |
| `font_light`, `font_regular`, `font_bold`, `font_mono` | TTF paths     |
| `utc_offset`   | Written by the hooks, e.g. `+0530`                    |
| `entry`        | `title \| loader \| logo \| background \| key \| accent` |

Loaders can also be `@firmware`, `@reboot` or `@shutdown`. An entry whose
loader file does not exist is skipped. Operating systems are always listed
before Firmware, Restart and Power Off.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Plymouth and themes</b></summary>

<br>

`setup.sh` installs one Plymouth theme, `aarambh`, on each OS. At every direct
boot Aarambh replaces its background, dots and script for that boot only, with
the launch splash of the theme set in `aarambh.conf`. Nothing on the disk
changes and the archive lives only in RAM (about 3 MB at 1280x800, 6 MB at
1920x1080).

Restart and shutdown follow the theme too. Plymouth runs from the OS's own
disk then, so when a Linux entry starts after a theme or resolution change,
Aarambh writes that OS's "Restarting" and "Shutting down" frames to
`\EFI\aarambh\shutdown\` (about 4 MB at 1280x800, 8 MB at 1920x1080 per
OS). `aarambh-clear`, which runs at every boot, copies them into the installed
`aarambh` Plymouth theme. No initramfs rebuild is needed. A shutdown right
after `aarambh --theme`, before booting once with the new theme, still shows
the old look.
Without these files Plymouth falls back to the splash `setup.sh` installed.
On systems that return to the initramfs at shutdown (dracut, used by Fedora
and Ubuntu 25.10 and later, or mkinitcpio's shutdown ramfs), Plymouth reloads
its theme from that initramfs copy late in the shutdown.
`aarambh-shutdown-splash.service` copies the current theme into it first, so
the themed splash stays until power off.

Limits:

- Only direct boots get the themed boot splash. A boot that falls back to
  GRUB shows the theme that `setup.sh` installed (restart and shutdown still
  follow the theme).
- After a theme change, restart and shutdown keep the old look until the OS
  has booted once with the new theme: the frames are drawn by Aarambh at
  boot and copied by `aarambh-clear` while the OS starts. So
  `aarambh --theme cinema` followed straight by a shutdown still shows the
  previous theme; every shutdown after the next boot shows Cinema.
- The frame is drawn at the firmware's screen resolution. If Plymouth runs at
  a different aspect ratio, the frame is scaled to cover the screen.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Command line (<code>aarambh</code>)</b></summary>

<br>

`setup.sh` installs `/usr/local/bin/aarambh` on every connected OS. Run it as
a normal user: the EFI partition is readable only by root, so it asks for your
password through `sudo` by itself. It edits
`\EFI\aarambh\aarambh.conf` on the shared EFI partition, so a change made from
Ubuntu also applies when you boot from Fedora, and the other way round.

```sh
aarambh --themes                      # list themes, * marks the current one
aarambh --theme cinema                # switch theme
aarambh --list                        # list menu entries, * marks the default
aarambh --default fedora              # boot Fedora by default
aarambh --default windows             # works for autodetected loaders too
aarambh --timeout 5                   # 5 second countdown, 0 disables it
aarambh -t cinema -d ubuntu -T 3      # several at once
aarambh                               # show theme, default and timeout
```

`--default` takes the OS id (the `ID=` from `/etc/os-release`), the menu
title, or an index. An id or title keeps pointing at the same OS when a new
installation adds an entry and the order changes; an index does not.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Custom logos</b></summary>

<br>

1. Find the id of the distribution (see **Distribution ids for logos**).
2. Save the logo as `assets/custom/<id>-logo.svg` (or `.png`). A single-color
   logo on a transparent background looks best; it is turned into a white
   logo like the built-in ones.
3. Run `make assets`. This creates `logos/<id>.png`, `backgrounds/<id>.jpg`
   (in the distribution's color from `assets/distros.conf`) and
   `plymouth/<id>/`.
4. Run `make install` again to copy them to the ESP, then
   `sudo bash /boot/efi/EFI/aarambh/hooks/setup.sh` on that distribution to
   install its Plymouth theme.

Each `plymouth/<id>/` folder holds only images. The Plymouth script and theme
file exist once, in `assets/plymouth/template/`; `make install` copies them
into every OS folder on the ESP, so a script change reaches every OS without
touching the folders.

`assets/custom/ubuntu-logo.svg` replaces a built-in logo the same way. A
distribution missing from `distros.conf` can be added there with one line.

Needs `imagemagick`, DejaVu fonts and `librsvg2-bin` (`rsvg-convert`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Boot splash on Arch-based systems</b></summary>

<br>

mkinitcpio only includes Plymouth when its hook is enabled, and Aarambh does
not edit `mkinitcpio.conf` for you. To get the splash:

1. Add `plymouth` to `HOOKS` in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, after `udev` (or
   `systemd`).
2. Add `splash` to your kernel command line (in `/etc/default/grub` or your
   systemd-boot entry).
3. Run `sudo mkinitcpio -P` and `sudo /usr/local/sbin/aarambh-kernels`.

`setup.sh` prints a reminder when the hook is missing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Kernel command line for direct boot</b></summary>

<br>

- BLS systems (Fedora family, systemd-boot): the `options` of each entry.
- Other systems: the command line of the running kernel, without
  `BOOT_IMAGE=`, `initrd=` and recovery-only options.

To use a fixed command line instead, write it to `/etc/aarambh/cmdline` and run
`sudo aarambh-kernels`. Recovery mode always starts through GRUB.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Themes</b></summary>

<br>

List them with `make themes` in the source folder, or `aarambh --themes`
once installed (it marks the current one with `*`). Choose a theme when
installing (`make install THEME=cinema`), later with
`aarambh --theme cinema`, or by editing the `theme` line in
`aarambh.conf`. Every theme works with any number of systems, shows the kernel
list and has its own launch splash and matching Plymouth splash.

Down opens it (Accordion, Minimal and Gallery: Down, then Enter).

Plymouth always continues the current theme's launch splash, with no
initramfs rebuild when you switch (see **Plymouth and themes**). A boot that
falls back to GRUB shows the Accordion-style splash installed by `setup.sh`.

A theme only draws; the core handles config, input, countdown, animation
state and booting. See [docs/THEMES.md](docs/THEMES.md) to write your own. The
smallest working example is `src/themes/minimal/minimal.c`.

<summary><b>Build and test</b></summary>

<br>

```sh
make            # build/aarambh.efi
make test       # setup.sh / uninstall.sh against simulated distributions
make qemu       # boot the menu in QEMU with sample entries
make assets     # regenerate logos, backgrounds and Plymouth themes
make clean
```

- `make test` creates fake Ubuntu (also with Secure Boot on), Fedora, Arch
  (GRUB and systemd-boot), openSUSE, Void and an unknown Ubuntu derivative in
  a temporary folder, with
  stub commands, and compares the results with `tests/hooks/expected/`.
  Nothing on your system is touched. `UPDATE=1 make test` rewrites the
  expected files after an intended change.
- `make qemu` builds a throwaway ESP image in `build/qemu/` with Ubuntu and
  Fedora entries plus fake Debian and Windows loaders for autodetect. It never
  touches your real ESP. `tests/qemu/run.sh --no-kvm` works without KVM.
- `make qemu SECURE_BOOT=1` (`tests/qemu/run.sh --secure-boot`) boots it like
  a real PC with Secure Boot on: OVMF with Microsoft's keys, your installed
  shim, and Aarambh signed with a throwaway key that is already in MOK. It
  needs `sbsigntool`, `openssl` and `virt-fw-vars` (`python3-virt-firmware`,
  or `pip install virt-firmware`). Pass `SHIM=<file>` and
  `MOK_MANAGER=<file>` when they are not found on their own.

## Troubleshooting

Known build and install problems, with the fix for each.

<details open>
<summary><b>Reporting a problem: the debug report</b></summary>

<br>

Boot the system normally (if Aarambh does not get you there, use the
firmware boot menu, see *Safety and recovery*), then run:

```sh
aarambh-debug          # installed by setup.sh
make debug             # from the source folder, also works if the install did not finish
```

It asks for your password, changes nothing, and saves
`~/aarambh-debug-<date>.txt`. The first lines are a summary marked
`[PROBLEM]`, `[NOTE]` and `[OK]`; the rest is the raw data behind them:

| Checked                 | What it looks at |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| Platform                | CPU architecture, UEFI or BIOS, 32/64-bit firmware, Secure Boot |
| Secure Boot             | Signing mode, signatures of `aarambh.efi` and the direct-boot kernel, the file shim starts, shim and MokManager next to Aarambh, whether the boot entry starts shim, whether the key is enrolled |
| Installation            | `/etc/aarambh.env`, the `aarambh` command and whether it is in your `PATH`, sudo's `secure_path` |
| EFI partition           | `\EFI\aarambh\` files, `aarambh.conf`, the kernel lists, free space, the menu entry for this OS |
| Direct boot             | Whether the copied kernel still has its modules in `/lib/modules`, `root=` points at a real filesystem, the initrd is not empty |
| Firmware entries        | `efibootmgr -v`, whether this boot went through Aarambh, whether the entry points at the mounted ESP |
| GRUB, initramfs         | `/etc/default/grub` and its changes, `MODULES=`, mkinitcpio `HOOKS`, whether the Aarambh Plymouth theme is inside the initramfs |
| Plymouth, graphics      | Selected theme, `splash` on the command line, GPU and driver, NVIDIA modesetting, encrypted disks |
| Logs                    | Errors and graphics/boot lines of this boot **and the previous one**, failed units, `setup.sh --dry-run` |

Your user name and host name are replaced with `<user>` and `<host>`. Read
the file before you attach it to an
[issue](https://github.com/NarkAgni/aarambh/issues/new).

If the summary says logs of earlier boots are not kept, turn them on, reproduce
the problem once, and run it again:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal && sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>aarambh: command not found</code> after installing</b></summary>

<br>

**Causes:**

1. Version 0.1.0 installed the command to `/usr/local/sbin`, which is not in
   a normal user's `PATH` on Debian, openSUSE and some other distributions.
2. `./scripts/install.sh --theme ...` in 0.1.0 passed `--theme` on to
   `setup.sh`, which stopped before installing anything for this OS.
3. `setup.sh` stopped with an error (for example
   `could not find the EFI loader`), so it never reached the step that
   installs the command.

**Fix:** pull the latest version and run the installer again. It now installs
`aarambh` and `aarambh-debug` to `/usr/local/bin` and removes the old copy:

```sh
cd aarambh && git pull
make install
```

On every other Linux on the same disk, run `setup.sh` again (see *Quick
start*). If it still fails, run `make debug`.

Run `aarambh` **without** `sudo`; it asks for your password itself. On
Fedora/RHEL-like systems `sudo aarambh` can still say *command not found*,
because sudo there only searches `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`. The full path
always works: `sudo /usr/local/bin/aarambh`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Black screen after installing</b></summary>

<br>

**First, get back into Linux:**

1. Wait about a minute. If the disk is encrypted, the black screen may be
   the password prompt: type the password and press **Enter**, or press
   **Esc** to show the text prompt.
2. Otherwise hold the power button to switch off, power on and open the
   firmware boot menu (**F12**, **F8**, **F11** or **Esc**). Choose your
   distribution's own entry (`ubuntu`, `fedora`, ...). That boots the way it
   did before Aarambh.

**Then run `aarambh-debug`** (or `make debug`) and attach the report. It
reads the log of the boot that went black. The usual causes, all of which it
checks:

| Summary line                                      | Fix |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----|
| NVIDIA driver without `nvidia-drm.modeset=1`      | `echo 'options nvidia-drm modeset=1' \| sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-drm-modeset.conf`, then rebuild the initramfs (below) |
| Direct-boot kernel has no modules in `/lib/modules` | `sudo /usr/local/sbin/aarambh-kernels` copies the current kernel again |
| `root=` points to a filesystem that does not exist | Write the full, correct command line to `/etc/aarambh/cmdline`, then `sudo /usr/local/sbin/aarambh-kernels` |
| No Aarambh Plymouth theme inside the initramfs    | Rebuild it: `sudo update-initramfs -u` (Debian, Ubuntu), `sudo dracut -f` (Fedora, openSUSE) or `sudo mkinitcpio -P` (Arch). The direct-boot copy is refreshed automatically |
| `MODULES=dep` and the root disk is not found      | Set `MODULES=most` in `/etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf`, then `sudo update-initramfs -u` |
| Secure Boot is on but Aarambh is not signed       | Install your distribution's shim package (`shim-signed`, `shim-x64`, `shim`), then run `setup.sh` again |
| The signing key is not enrolled                   | `sudo aarambh-sign`, then restart and enroll it in MokManager |

To go back to the old boot completely, see **Uninstall** under *Safety and
recovery*.

<summary><b><code>'gEfiLoadFile2ProtocolGuid' redeclared as different kind of symbol</code></b></summary>

<br>

```
/usr/include/efi/efilib.h:108:27: error: 'gEfiLoadFile2ProtocolGuid' redeclared as different kind of symbol
  108 | #define LoadFile2Protocol gEfiLoadFile2ProtocolGuid
src/boot/initrd.c:11:3: note: in expansion of macro 'LoadFile2Protocol'
```

**Cause:** gnu-efi 4.x defines `LoadFile2Protocol` as a macro in `efilib.h`.
Any type or variable with that name gets replaced by the GUID symbol.

**Fix:** fixed in `src/boot/initrd.c`, where the protocol struct is now named
`InitrdLoadFile2`. In new code, do not name anything after gnu-efi protocol
aliases (`LoadFile2Protocol`, `LoadedImageProtocol`, `DevicePathProtocol`,
`GraphicsOutputProtocol`, ...).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>crt0-efi-x86_64.o not found</code> / <code>elf_x86_64_efi.lds not found</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** gnu-efi is not installed.

**Fix:** install it with the command for your distribution in **Quick start**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>Permission denied</code> when running a script</b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** the executable bit was lost when the files were downloaded or
copied from a FAT partition.

**Fix:**

```sh
chmod +x scripts/*.sh tests/*/run.sh hooks/*.sh hooks/bin/* hooks/triggers/* hooks/grub/01_aarambh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>this system was booted in legacy BIOS mode</code> / <code>no EFI system partition found</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** the machine booted in BIOS (CSM) mode, or the ESP is not mounted.

**Fix:** check with `ls /sys/firmware/efi` (must exist) and `findmnt -t vfat`.
Switch the firmware to UEFI mode, or mount the ESP. If it is mounted somewhere
other than `/boot/efi`, `/efi` or `/boot`, run with
`AARAMBH_ESP=/your/mountpoint`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>could not find the EFI loader of ...</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** `setup.sh` could not tell which folder under `\EFI\` belongs to this
installation (for example a custom `grub-install --bootloader-id`, or a boot
loader other than GRUB and systemd-boot).

**Fix:** look at the folders and pass the right file:

```sh
ls /boot/efi/EFI/*/
sudo bash /boot/efi/EFI/aarambh/hooks/setup.sh --loader '\EFI\MyLinux\grubx64.efi'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>not enough space on the EFI partition, direct boot disabled</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** the newest kernel and initramfs do not fit on the ESP with 8 MB to
spare.

**Effect:** nothing breaks. That OS boots through its own loader instead.

**Fix:** free space on the ESP or make the initramfs smaller (initramfs-tools:
`MODULES=dep` is already set; dracut: `hostonly="yes"`), then run
`sudo aarambh-kernels`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Two installations show the same entry, or one is missing</b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** both use the same `ID` (for example two Ubuntu installs) or the same
`\EFI\<dir>\` (Linux Mint also installs into `\EFI\ubuntu\`).

**Fix:** pass a different loader with `--loader`, or edit the two `entry` lines
in `aarambh.conf` by hand.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Blue screen: <code>Verification failed: (0x1A) Security Violation</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** Secure Boot is on and shim does not trust the key Aarambh is
signed with yet. Shim then opens MokManager.

**Fix:** pick **Continue boot** (or wait); the firmware starts your OS's own
boot entry. In the OS run:

```sh
sudo aarambh-sign             # asks shim to enroll the key
sudo aarambh-sign --password  # the password MokManager will ask for
```

Restart and choose **Enroll MOK → Continue → Yes**, type the password,
**Reboot**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The blue <i>Perform MOK management</i> screen comes back at every restart</b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** the enrollment was not confirmed (the screen timed out, or
**Continue boot** was picked), and with Secure Boot on Aarambh asks again at
every start, because shim cannot start it without the key.

**Fix:** at the next restart choose **Enroll MOK → Continue → Yes** and type
the password from `sudo aarambh-sign --password`. If you would rather not use
Secure Boot, turn it off in the firmware setup; Aarambh keeps working and
stops asking.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>MokManager says the password is wrong</b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** an old password, or the number keys on the numeric keypad with
Num Lock off.

**Fix:** read the current one with `sudo aarambh-sign --password` and type it
with the number row above the letters. After three wrong tries MokManager
restarts the PC; the request stays and the screen comes back.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The menu says <i>Blocked by Secure Boot</i></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** shim refused the kernel or loader of that entry: it is signed with
a key the PC does not trust, or not signed at all. Aarambh then starts the OS's
own boot loader.

**Fix:** run `setup.sh` once on that OS, so its kernel copy is signed with its
key. For a custom kernel, sign it with your MOK key, or let `aarambh-kernels`
copy and sign it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>sbsigntools and mokutil could not be installed</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** `setup.sh` found shim and tried to install the signing tools with
your package manager, which failed (no network, or a package name it does not
know).

**Fix:** install them yourself and run `setup.sh` again:

| Distribution        | Command |
|---------------------|---------|
| Debian, Ubuntu      | `sudo apt install sbsigntool mokutil` |
| Fedora              | `sudo dnf install sbsigntools mokutil` |
| openSUSE            | `sudo zypper install sbsigntools mokutil` |
| Arch                | `sudo pacman -S sbsigntools mokutil` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>Could not access KVM kernel module</code> in <code>make qemu</code></b></summary>

<br>

**Cause:** KVM is not available (inside a VM, or virtualization is disabled
in the firmware).

**Fix:** run without KVM. It is slower but works:

```sh
./tests/qemu/run.sh --no-kvm
```

</details>
